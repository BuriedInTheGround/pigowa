# pigowa

pigowa is a Go interface for using [p5.js](https://p5js.org) in the browser,
exploiting the power of [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org).

The implementation is ongoing, and things may change. The
[`syscall/js`](https://pkg.go.dev/syscall/js@go1.16) package is itself
considered experimental.
